## Note: WIP

This project is close to become published. Check out the release section for current release-candidates.

## Features

- üì¶ no dependencies and no runtime-specific dependencies (besides ES6 + Promises)
- ü™∂ minimal core with (xkb; see the [sizes table](#file-sizes))
- üß† very easy to use API
- üß© highly extensible from the ground up
- üìù use declarative workflows and enrich them with custom functionality

### Entry Points

Tonyflow packages offer multiple entry point files, suited for different environments.
Nowadays, you might want to stick with ESM but we also provide cjs, es5 and iife versions of the build, including
sourcemaps and a minified version, too.

They're all placed in the respective package's `/dist` folder and committed to this repository.

## Usage

Internally there are two classes, `Workflow` and `Step` that act for the whole engine.
If you only want the `core` package then you will have to manage them manually.

Depending on your use-case, this might be exactly what you want or not want.
If you want a more comfortable solution (suitable for beginners), you might also want to install `@tinyflow/instances`.

## File sizes

Tinyflow comes with a minimal core but also provides extensions out-of-the-box.
At the same time we build Tinyflow for multiple outputs.

The following table shows the size of the various builds, available in their respective `/dist` folders.
Note, that this overview shows only the sizes for the minified versions of each, excluding sourcemaps. 

| package               | esm             | cjs                                                                                                                              | es5                                                                                                                                        | iife |
